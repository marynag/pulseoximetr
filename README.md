Implementation of devices for measuring heart rate and saturation

Pulse oximeter is a medical control and diagnostic device for measuring the level of oxygen saturation of capillary blood. This device allows you to measure heart rate and saturation level from a photoplethysmogram.

The algorithm of programs consists of the following main points:
1. Connecting libraries
2. Initialize and configure the appropriate components.
3. Detection of heartbeat.
4. Processing of values by means of formulas.
5. Display the result.
6. Display images


One of the most important indicators in the human body is oxygen, as it is used to convert sugar into units of energy, which are important for the process of life. Oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), which is hemoglobin in combination with oxygen, which supplies cells with oxygen. Measurement and calculation of its amount is carried out using the indicator of blood saturation (SpO2). The normal level of saturation for humans is 95%, and the level of 92% is already considered critical and the need for urgent medical intervention.
